-- INFR 1350U Framework
-- Shawn Matthews (August 26, 2019)

-- This premake file sets up an easy to use framework for developing graphics applications, and allows easy addition
-- of other frameworks and libraries where required.
-- This build config is inspired by the Hazel Engine build system (https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel), as well as
-- David Arpe's CMAKE system

local rootDir = path.getabsolute(_WORKING_DIR)

-- Log what the startup project will be

-- Get all the directories in our projects directory
local projects = os.matchdirs(rootDir .. "\\projects\\*")

if (projects[#projects]) then
	-- Select the last item in the project directory to be our startup project 
	-- (this is easily changed in VS, this is just to be handy)
	startup = path.getbasename(projects[#projects])
